We possibly can instead of selling it to the cinema , just build it and be the one that links cinemas to users meaning the cinemas will keep working as they were we are going to be an addition that 
people can use to book tickets and we just need someone in the gate that scans the qr code , 
however we might encounter some problems in combining both manual and online purchase for better management . and we also cant work with out a deal with the cineams like splitting the revenue or getting
a small persentage off .
