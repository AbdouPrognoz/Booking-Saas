- this guy built a full app that handles events tickets , it has some insane features like queue system and also some pretty good admin dashboard , also it handles canceling an event and refunding
the customors , with multi factor authentification , tho for algeria we might need better ways to secure it and deal with bad people,
with rate limiting for 30 min , however he uses clerk and convex , lclhost
backend with convex is wild for huge production
